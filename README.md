## About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Michal Andrzejewski, a double BSc student in Mathematics and Philosophy at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, currently on an academic exchange at the University of Warwick. My academic journey has been driven by a profound interest in the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, and finance, which has led me to pursue a MicroMasters Program in Finance at MIT. This multidisciplinary background has equipped me with strong analytical, quantitative, and critical thinking skills, which I aim to apply in the field of quantitative research.

## Professional Aspirations

With experience as a Global Finance and Business Management Summer Analyst at J.P. Morgan in Warsaw, I have developed a solid foundation in financial analysis, risk management, and programming. My goal is to become a Quantitative Researcher, where I can leverage my skills in mathematics, finance, and programming to contribute to the development of innovative financial models and strategies.

## Repository Overview

This GitHub repository will serve as a platform for sharing my non-work-related projects, particularly those focused on quantitative finance, mathematical modeling, and computational techniques. Here, you will find a collection of my personal projects, ranging from algorithmic trading strategies to data analysis tools, all reflecting my passion for research and innovation in finance.

## Connect with Me

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me to discuss potential collaborations, research opportunities, or career advice. I am always open to learning and exchanging ideas with fellow enthusiasts in the field.
